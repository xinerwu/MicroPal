Script and pre-processed data for extracting modern sea ice concentration and sea ice duration in months/year at specific study sites.
The original dataset from NSIDC: https://nsidc.org/data/g10010/versions/2
matlab.mat: data averaged over the years 1955-2012 to stay in line with what was used in the n=1968 database
The "presence" of sea ice is defined as sea ice concentration >50%, also in line with n=1968
seaiceconc_1981_2020_mean.nc: average of years 1981-2020 for a quick visualisation in netcdf format
